<li> I work 8:00AM to 5:00PM PT. The time after, as well as on weekends, is reserved for family and personal projects. I am not on company e-mail or IM during that time.</li>
<li> I generally don‚Äôt answer e-mails after hours or on weekends, with a few and occasional exceptions, that are just that - exception.</li>
<li> I do not answer emails or attend meetings during vacation time. I strongly believe that this time is crucial to recharging and focusing on my family. I encourage my peers to do the same.</li>
<li> The corollary to the statement above is that I don‚Äôt expect anyone to answer my emails or IMs when they are on vacation - it can be done once you‚Äôre back and refreshed.</li>
<li> If you get an email from me at odd times, you do not need to respond to it that moment. Do it at your own time. If it would be urgent, I would reach out to you in a different way that is not e-mail.</li>
<li> I am remote; therefore documentation takes precedence over in-person communication. Let‚Äôs write things down and have a conversation in the document/work item before setting up meetings or starting another long email thread. If something is not documented, it might as well not exist.</li>
<li> Despite being remote, I strongly believe in the value of face-to-face communication. It‚Äôs important to regularly meet with the people I work with to discuss how I can help and plug in better into the existing projects.</li>
<li> I write more than I talk. Writing allows one to better flesh out their thoughts before sharing them broadly. Send me your comments in the document!</li>
<li> Email threads that need narrative or long explanations should be documents.</li>
<li> Instant messages that need long explanations should be documents.</li>
<li> I set up meetings to hash out ideas and/or build partnerships. I do not set up meetings for status updates - that can be done asynchronously.</li>
<li> Before setting up a meeting, ask - ‚ÄúCan I write this down/will this be useful for others?‚Äù</li>
<li> Most email is not urgent. If there is truly an urgent matter, please reach out to me during work hours or through means other than email.</li>
<li> I am serious about having focus time - that‚Äôs when I get the most impactful work done. If I haven‚Äôt answered your email or IM, I will do so within a reasonable time frame; I triage those requests at the start and end of day, and tend to get to ‚ÄúInbox Zero‚Äù weekly.</li>
<li> I have no issues with my work being seen by other partners/teams - I am transparent about the documents and presentations I write. Want to know about something I work on? Ask and I will point you to the document or work item where that is outlined!</li>
<li> Instead of sending status emails, I update work items and have written, internally accessible artifacts that you can refer to for the latest update on a project.</li>
<li> Occasionally you will get emails from me that announce new features or capabilities. Those will be infrequent.</li>
<li> I like to stick to the top-right corner of the Impact/Effort matrix.</li>
<li> I value honesty, inclusiveness and directness - if you feel like I am missing the mark on anything, please call me out on it.</li>
<li> My metaphorical ‚Äúdoor‚Äù (remember, I am remote?) is always open. Blocked? Need clarification? Have a question? Ask me! I will always be happy to chat.</li>
<li> Time for self-development is critical. I book regular times to do it and encourage others to do the same.</li>

‚ú® ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the low-effort, low-impact work that can kill you, because it‚Äôs so attractive. Hunter refers to it as ‚Äúsnacking‚Äù. It feels rewarding and can solve a short term problem, but if you never eat anything of substance you‚Äôll suffer.‚Äù ‚ú®
